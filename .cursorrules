# Cursor AI Rules for Deep Learning Project

## Code Standards
- All code, comments, and documentation must be in English
- Follow existing code style and conventions in the project
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names

## Documentation
- NEVER create new .md files
- Only add to README.md if absolutely necessary
- Keep documentation concise and integrated with existing sections
- Prefer inline code comments for implementation details

## Formatting
- NEVER use emojis in code, comments, or output
- Use plain text symbols and formatting only
- Keep output clean and professional

## Execution
- NEVER run Python commands directly using run_terminal_cmd
- The Cursor environment is different from the user's venv
- Only suggest commands for the user to run themselves
- Use read_file, search_replace, and other non-execution tools instead

## Project-Specific
- This is a PyTorch-based vessel segmentation pipeline
- Configuration files are in YAML format
- Models are registered using a decorator pattern
- Training and testing use separate scripts (train.py, test.py)
- Memory profiling is available via debug config section
